Tender Trust is a blockchain-based tendering system designed to revolutionize procurement processes by ensuring transparency, accountability, and trust. Built using the BERN stack (Blockchain - Ethereum, Express, React, and Node.js), it leverages smart contracts to facilitate tender creation, bidding, and contract assignment between government officials and contractors. Key features include:

Tender Creation: Government officials can create tenders and manage the tendering process.
Bidding System: Contractors can view active tenders and place bids, with all interactions recorded on the blockchain.
Contract Assignment: Officials assign contracts to winning bidders, ensuring transparency.
Public Accessibility: The system allows the public to view active tenders and awarded contracts, enhancing accountability.

The project integrates Metamask wallets for authentication and ensures secure interactions with the Ethereum blockchain using the web3 library. It is aimed at improving procurement practices by reducing fraud and enhancing trust between parties.
